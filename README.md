# Curious

Curious is a web framework built on top of curio async that supports http/1.1 and http2.
The framework is designed to include seamless websockets support in the future.

## Development

The framework currently includes a set of scripts to install dependencies through pipenv,
run tests, run lints and run the application. See scripts in the `./scripts` directory

Switching to tox for development and testing would be an easy improvement to make here.

## Quickstart

Check out the example(s) in the `examples` directory to see how to use the library
